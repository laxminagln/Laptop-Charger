At its most basic, all you really need is a cheap battery pack, a voltage booster, 
and a cable for charging your laptop.
Core
Regular Cellphone Charging Battery Pack (5Volts)
Step-Up Power Converter Module
A charging cable for your laptop 
USB Cable
There are a couple extra things that make building this a bit easier. For instance 
if you have an apple laptop, they sell really cheap cables for them that are already 
split out into two leads.
Helpful Accessories
Male and Female Barrel Plug Adapters.
Chop your USB cable and isolate its positive and negative power leads (black and red) 
(or just use one of these USB connectors: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/437 ) 
Connect the positive and negative USB leads to the Input side of the power-booster 
(to the + and - respectively) 
Plug the USB into the battery to see if it turns on (should light up with the display) 
Turn the small screw potentiometer until the output display shows around 19-20V (it 
will bounce around a bit). Also check to see what voltage your laptop needs (most want 
about 18-20V).
Now take that repair cable that charges your computer and connect its positive and 
negative ends to the + and - of the Output side (if you just have a spare AC adapter 
for your laptop, chop off the end leading to your computer and strip out its positive 
and negative ends) 
Connect to your laptop!
If all goes well, your laptop should start getting fed extra juice!
Now some laptops are much more power-hungry than others,and will react in different 
ways. For instance, my macbook retina 15inch will display the power connection as 
"Plugged in, not charging" and will still make the laptop last for 14+ hours. Other 
smaller laptops, like my macbook air, are much less power-hungry, and actually start 
charging from this. They also charge quicker (if that's what you are looking to do), 
while they are turned off.
